				<p epub:type="bridgehead">The reader’s neck brought into danger by a description; his escape; and the great condescension of Miss Bridget Allworthy.</p>
			</header>
			<p>The Gothic style of building could produce nothing nobler than <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Allworthy’s house. There was an air of grandeur in it that struck you with awe, and rivalled the beauties of the best Grecian architecture; and it was as commodious within as venerable without.</p>
			<p>It stood on the southeast side of a hill, but nearer the bottom than the top of it, so as to be sheltered from the northeast by a grove of old oaks which rose above it in a gradual ascent of near half a mile, and yet high enough to enjoy a most charming prospect of the valley beneath.</p>
			<p>In the midst of the grove was a fine lawn, sloping down towards the house, near the summit of which rose a plentiful spring, gushing out of a rock covered with firs, and forming a constant cascade of about thirty feet, not carried down a regular flight of steps, but tumbling in a natural fall over the broken and mossy stones till it came to the bottom of the rock, then running off in a pebbly channel, that with many lesser falls winded along, till it fell into a lake at the foot of the hill, about a quarter of a mile below the house on the south side, and which was seen from every room in the front. Out of this lake, which filled the center of a beautiful plain, embellished with groups of beeches and elms, and fed with sheep, issued a river, that for several miles was seen to meander through an amazing variety of meadows and woods till it emptied itself into the sea, with a large arm of which, and an island beyond it, the prospect was closed.</p>
			<p>On the right of this valley opened another of less extent, adorned with several villages, and terminated by one of the towers of an old ruined abby, grown over with ivy, and part of the front, which remained still entire.</p>
			<p>The left-hand scene presented the view of a very fine park, composed of very unequal ground, and agreeably varied with all the diversity that hills, lawns, wood, and water, laid out with admirable taste, but owing less to art than to nature, could give. Beyond this, the country gradually rose into a ridge of wild mountains, the tops of which were above the clouds.</p>
			<p>It was now the middle of May, and the morning was remarkably serene, when <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Allworthy walked forth on the terrace, where the dawn opened every minute that lovely prospect we have before described to his eye; and now having sent forth streams of light, which ascended the blue firmament before him, as harbingers preceding his pomp, in the full blaze of his majesty rose the sun, than which one object alone in this lower creation could be more glorious, and that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Allworthy himself presented⁠—a human being replete with benevolence, meditating in what manner he might render himself most acceptable to his Creator, by doing most good to his creatures.</p>
			<p>Reader, take care. I have unadvisedly led thee to the top of as high a hill as <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Allworthy’s, and how to get thee down without breaking thy neck, I do not well know. However, let us e’en venture to slide down together; for Miss Bridget rings her bell, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Allworthy is summoned to breakfast, where I must attend, and, if you please, shall be glad of your company.</p>
			<p>The usual compliments having passed between <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Allworthy and Miss Bridget, and the tea being poured out, he summoned <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Wilkins, and told his sister he had a present for her, for which she thanked him⁠—imagining, I suppose, it had been a gown, or some ornament for her person. Indeed, he very often made her such presents; and she, in complacence to him, spent much time in adorning herself. I say in complacence to him, because she always expressed the greatest contempt for dress, and for those ladies who made it their study.</p>
			<p>But if such was her expectation, how was she disappointed when <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Wilkins, according to the order she had received from her master, produced the little infant? Great surprises, as hath been observed, are apt to be silent; and so was Miss Bridget, till her brother began, and told her the whole story, which, as the reader knows it already, we shall not repeat.</p>
			<p>Miss Bridget had always expressed so great a regard for what the ladies are pleased to call virtue, and had herself maintained such a severity of character, that it was expected, especially by Wilkins, that she would have vented much bitterness on this occasion, and would have voted for sending the child, as a kind of noxious animal, immediately out of the house; but, on the contrary, she rather took the good-natured side of the question, intimated some compassion for the helpless little creature, and commended her brother’s charity in what he had done.</p>
			<p>Perhaps the reader may account for this behaviour from her condescension to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Allworthy, when we have informed him that the good man had ended his narrative with owning a resolution to take care of the child, and to breed him up as his own; for, to acknowledge the truth, she was always ready to oblige her brother, and very seldom, if ever, contradicted his sentiments. She would, indeed, sometimes make a few observations, as that men were headstrong, and must have their own way, and would wish she had been blessed with an independent fortune; but these were always vented in a low voice, and at the most amounted only to what is called muttering.</p>
			<p>However, what she withheld from the infant, she bestowed with the utmost profuseness on the poor unknown mother, whom she called an impudent slut, a wanton hussy, an audacious harlot, a wicked jade, a vile strumpet, with every other appellation with which the tongue of virtue never fails to lash those who bring a disgrace on the sex.</p>
			<p>A consultation was now entered into how to proceed in order to discover the mother. A scrutiny was first made into the characters of the female servants of the house, who were all acquitted by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Wilkins, and with apparent merit; for she had collected them herself, and perhaps it would be difficult to find such another set of scarecrows.</p>
			<p>The next step was to examine among the inhabitants of the parish; and this was referred to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Wilkins, who was to enquire with all imaginable diligence, and to make her report in the afternoon.</p>
			<p>Matters being thus settled, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Allworthy withdrew to his study, as was his custom, and left the child to his sister, who, at his desire, had undertaken the care of it.</p>
